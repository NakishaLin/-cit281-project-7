Project-7

This is the last project of the term!!!

This project mainly focuses on working with Github. Creating a repository and Gitbut pages is really important for this project. 
This includes what I am doing right now, creating a portfolio. Even if I am not sure if I am going to continue with this minor, I love how my portfolio turns out. It indicates all of my hard work for this term. 

A huge THANK YOU to Blaise, who has been so helpful with all my questions.
